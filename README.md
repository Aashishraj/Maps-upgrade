# Maps-upgrade
In this app, the direction showing part is updated. As in google maps, many people face the problem like in which direction to go if the net speed is slow or if the phone is getting crashed.
For each direction, the route will be color-coded for north, south, east, and west and the following remaining sub-directions. This will be very useful even if the phone network is not working properly or if the phone is getting crashed.
Let say if a person is currently facing north then we will color code the direction which are in front to say red, and we will color code the remaing direction.
If the phone's network is not working properly then also the user will know the the front direction is coded as south in the map and I am facing north. So I'll know that the map is not updated and I'll go in the direction by matching with the phone's compass.
