# Maps-upgrade
In this app the direction showing is updated. As in google maps many people face the problem like in which direction to go if the net speed is slow or if the phone is getting crashed.
For each direction the route will be colour coded for north, south, east and west and the follwing remaining sub-directions.
This will be very useful even if the phone net is not working properly or if the phone is getting crashed.
